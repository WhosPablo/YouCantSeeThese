# Procrastination Be Gone

A simple chrome extension that shows you the top ten sites you've been spending the most time on and lets you block those 
pesky distraction filled sites that wont let you move on with your project/life/studies. 

It enlists the help of a good ol' friend...

Add to chrome and click on the extension icon in the top right. It'll open up a tab with all you need to get your life together.
